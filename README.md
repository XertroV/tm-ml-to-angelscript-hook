# Refresh Data

This plugin provides a main menu item to call DataFileManager's refresh functions for UserData, Maps, and Replays.
(Note: I do not think this works for items in the map editor)

If you want to load something through `Documents\Trackmania\...`, then sometimes you need to restart the game to get it to load.

This plugin can help, sometimes.
Example: if I want to load a skin from `D\T\Skins\Models\HelmetPilot` then I usually need to restart the game.
Now, I can:
1. populate the skin directory
2. call `refresh data > all media`
3. attempt to load `D\T\Skins\Models\HelmetPilot\TheSkin.zip`
**in that order** (i think)
