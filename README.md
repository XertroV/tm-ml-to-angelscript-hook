# Manialink to AngelScript Hook

A dependency plugin (for use by other plugins) to enable running code at the same time as Manialink does.

This allows the use of `SendCustomEvent` on script handlers without crashing the game.
In general, it seems to allow calling code when `.Page` is not null.
As far as I can tell, this is only true when Manialink code is executing.
